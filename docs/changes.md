# Changes & Updates to the Standards

Our development standards and best practices are always evolving. This repository is the source of truth for the
standards and best practices we use at Turo. This document is a changelog of the changes and updates to the standards as
well as the toll that we use the make these changes.

If you have a suggestion for a change or update to the standards, please open an issue in this repository.

Changes are managed through pull requests and merged using
the [Rebase & Merge](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#rebase-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits)
workflow.

## Guidelines for changes

At Turo we believe in convention & prior art over configuration and bespoke creations. To that end, we try to base our
standards and practices off of industry standards and best practices. When making changes to the standards or
substantial existing prior art.

We use this document to allow us:

- To clarify how an existing standard might be applied
- To extend an existing pattern where we see a need -- for example: allowing for splitting `variables.tf` into
  multiple `variables.<function>.tf` files.
- To define best practices where we have found no prior examples or subtantial prior art

In general, if you are proposing a new change we hope that the change is based on prior art and that you can provide
examples of how the change is being used in the industry.
